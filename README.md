      We are living in a pivotal time in human history when the people are on the verge of taking the reigns of their own destiny. Cryptocurrency has given the "Average Man" a new tool to empower his own future and change his lot. Like in the past, if a man is too close to the heavens the gods must try to strike him down. The so-called "experts" have enacted a bunch of new tax laws which are so convoluted and impossible to follow that on April 15th many Americans will become criminals and face harsh penalties. These regulations will basically kill crypto as a currency and make settling trades a costly event.

Let me start by saying that i am a law-abiding citizen who wants to pay my fair share and i do not support breaking the law and THIS IS NOT MY INTENTION.  i also feel that long-term capital gains taxes seem  logical and promote holding bitcoin (this is good) however, the short-term capital gains tax on all crypto transactions (for short-term  holds) is unfair(extra taxes for payees who work for crypto and merchants who accept crypto) and impossible to track without hiring a very expensive accountant.  Some people (especially freelance programmers in the blockchain space) ACTUALLY USE CRYPTO AS A PAYMENT METHOD AND CURRENCY!!!! Miners will have a very trim profit margin (mining was previously tax-free) and many people will have years of headaches and litigation ahead of them.

Furthermore, it is futile and short-sighted to attempt forcing crypto into the old world model. A permissionless globally distributed anonymous system dosent behave in the way that a centralized system does. There are many uses for crypto and many kinds of crypto users. it is impossible to create a "one size fits all"  blanket tax and securities regulatory statute. That is kind of the point of these networks.

We are a small crew of programmers, miners, and traders who come from different backgrounds and ideologies. We have started this project with four key goals:
       1) To create a privacy-focused network using zero-knowledge and obfuscation thus rendering regulations pointless.
       2) To raise awareness about the unfairness of regulations to crypto USERS and MINERS
       3) To create a support system for people arrested or tried for tax evasion when they were not engaged in trading cryptos as a business (ie. for mining or spending crypto). We would like to start a foundation and help people by providing lawyers and accountants if needed.
       4)To Work towards a fairer system by pursuing facetime with legislators to enact fair legislation.
